== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.02 and above =
If you have to upgrade manually, simply delete <code>hikari-enhanced-comments</code> folder and follow installation steps again.

You don't need to touch ip2nation tables once they are installed, but since they are updated from time to time, you may want to update them to have info about all IPs. In this case, just import the lastest .sql file to your database.
